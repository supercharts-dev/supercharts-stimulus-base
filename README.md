# DEPRECATED supercharts-stimulus-base

A set of base Stimulus controllers for [Supercharts for Bullet Train](https://github.com/supercharts-dev/supercharts-bullet_train)

## Removing This Dependency, Run it Locally

If you already include the supercharts-bullet_train gem, simply run the following rake task:

    bin/rails supercharts:eject_all

This will eject local copies of this package's source JavaScript files into `javascript/ssupercharts/stimulus-base/*`
